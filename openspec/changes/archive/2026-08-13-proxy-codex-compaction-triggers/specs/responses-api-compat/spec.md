## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Codex compaction triggers are bridged into compact output

When `POST /backend-api/codex/responses` receives a request whose top-level `input` array contains exactly one `{"type":"compaction_trigger"}` item as its final element, the proxy SHALL preserve that trigger and forward the request through the subscription-backed upstream Responses streaming path. It MUST NOT translate the request into a standalone `/responses/compact` call.

The proxy MUST relay the upstream compaction SSE lifecycle through the Codex route without synthesizing a replacement response or compaction item. Upstream event ordering, sequence numbers, compaction item identifiers, status, and encrypted content MUST be preserved.

For Codex-affinity standalone compact requests, `POST /backend-api/codex/responses/compact` SHALL normalize an upstream remote-compaction-v2 response that includes historical message output plus a compaction summary into the single compact output item required by Codex clients. A non-empty upstream compaction item `id` or `status` MUST be preserved in that normalized output item.

OpenAI-style `/v1/responses/compact` is unchanged by this requirement.

#### Scenario: terminal trigger emits a complete compact lifecycle
- **WHEN** a `POST /backend-api/codex/responses` request ends with exactly one top-level `compaction_trigger`
- **THEN** the proxy forwards the trigger unchanged through the normal upstream Responses stream
- **AND** it does not call the standalone compact endpoint

#### Scenario: encrypted compaction item identity survives trigger streaming
- **WHEN** the upstream Responses stream emits compaction lifecycle events for a terminal trigger
- **THEN** the Codex route relays those events without synthesizing replacements
- **AND** upstream sequence numbers, compaction item ID, status, and encrypted content are preserved

#### Scenario: malformed trigger placement is rejected
- **WHEN** a `POST /backend-api/codex/responses` request contains a duplicated or non-terminal top-level `compaction_trigger` item
- **THEN** the proxy returns HTTP 400 with `invalid_request_error`
- **AND** it does not attempt upstream Responses or standalone compact handling

#### Scenario: Codex-affinity standalone compact normalizes remote v2 output
- **WHEN** a Codex-affinity `POST /backend-api/codex/responses/compact` request receives upstream output that contains historical message items and one compaction summary item
- **THEN** the JSON response body contains exactly one `output` item for that compaction summary
- **AND** the normalized item preserves the compaction summary's non-empty upstream ID and status
- **AND** it does not expose historical message items as standalone compact output

### Requirement: Compact trimming preserves prioritised historical side effects

The service MUST retain recognised historical side-effect tool calls as bounded
priority context when an oversized compact input is trimmed. It MUST use the
same side-effect classifier as downstream replay
deduplication. This includes code-mode `exec` and `collaboration` wrapper calls
as well as their lower-level tool spellings and recognised parallel batches.

For each retained historical side effect, compact trimming MUST retain its
matching call and output together. The service MUST reserve space for that
complete pair before selecting optional ordinary head or tail context. Required
state anchors and the current required item remain mandatory; if they leave no
room for a historical pair, the service MAY drop that pair together and retain a
trim marker instead.

A recognised side-effect call without a non-empty `call_id` MUST NOT be
retained as a historical side-effect anchor, because it cannot form a verified
call/output pair.

#### Scenario: Code-mode side effect survives an oversized compact input

- **WHEN** an oversized compact input contains a historical custom `exec` or
  `collaboration` call with its matching output outside required state context
- **THEN** the trimmed upstream input retains both the call and its output when
  the pair fits with required state
- **AND** optional ordinary tail context is dropped before that pair

#### Scenario: Historical side-effect pair cannot fit with required state

- **WHEN** required state anchors and the current required item leave no room
  for a historical side-effect call and its matching output
- **THEN** compact trimming drops the entire historical pair
- **AND** it does not retain only one member of that pair

#### Scenario: Side-effect call lacks a usable pair key

- **WHEN** an oversized compact input contains a recognised historical
  side-effect call without a non-empty `call_id`
- **THEN** compact trimming does not preserve that call as a side-effect anchor
- **AND** it does not emit an unpaired historical side-effect call upstream

#### Scenario: Final compact wire expansion is rejected locally

- **WHEN** Unicode escaping, JSON array framing, or image inlining makes the final compact input exceed the upstream limit
- **THEN** the service returns `responses_compact_input_too_large` before an upstream attempt
- **AND** any API-key reservation is released
- **AND** no upstream account is penalized

#### Scenario: Terminal compaction trigger validates before admission

- **WHEN** a streaming Responses request ends with `compaction_trigger`
- **THEN** the service validates terminal trigger placement before admission
- **AND** a valid request follows normal Responses admission and wire-budget handling without deriving a standalone compact payload

#### Scenario: Enforced non-Lite model rejects Lite input

- **WHEN** API-key policy rewrites Lite-shaped input to a model whose catalog metadata disables Responses Lite
- **THEN** the service rejects the request before any upstream HTTP or websocket attempt

#### Scenario: Replayed code-mode side effects are emitted once

- **WHEN** reconnect replay repeats the same code-mode `exec` or `collaboration` call identity
- **THEN** the downstream client receives that side-effecting call only once

#### Scenario: Distinct code-mode calls remain distinct

- **WHEN** request history has different call IDs with identical code-mode source text and matching outputs
- **THEN** every call and matching output remains in the forwarded history
