## Request-aware reservation estimate

The admission budget for token and `cost_usd` limits (Requirement
"Request-aware API-key usage reservations") sizes the input side from the
forwarded request payload: `min(utf8_length(serialized_payload_minus_caps), 8192)`.
Two implementation notes keep that value exact while avoiding redundant work on
the hot path:

- **Shared dump.** `ResponsesRequest.to_payload()` is deterministic, so the
  HTTP bridge prepare path computes it once and threads the same dict through
  client-metadata derivation, the forwarded `response.create` frame and
  `estimate_api_key_request_usage(payload, upstream_payload=...)`. The budget,
  frame bytes and input fingerprints are byte-identical to computing each stage
  from its own dump. When the prepare path rewrites the request (replayed
  side-effect tool-call dedupe under `previous_response_id`) the caller's dump
  is discarded and recomputed from the rewritten request, so the forwarded
  frame never carries un-deduped input. Callers that do not hold a dump keep
  the default single-argument form.
- **Early-exit serialization.** Because the estimate is capped at 8192 bytes,
  the estimator returns the cap as soon as it is proven: an `instructions`
  string of 8192+ characters alone suffices (a JSON string literal is never
  shorter than its character count), otherwise the payload is streamed through
  the same `sort_keys`/`ensure_ascii=False` encoder and stopped once 8192 bytes
  have been produced. Sub-cap payloads still yield the exact serialized length.
  The opaque-context checks (`previous_response_id`, `conversation`, file or
  image references) run before either shortcut, so the conservative `None`
  budget is unchanged.

Edge: a lone surrogate (`"\ud800"`) anywhere in the payload used to raise
`UnicodeEncodeError` (HTTP 500) from the full dump. It now raises only when it
sits in a chunk that is actually UTF-8 encoded, i.e. within the first ~8 KiB of
serialized output and not inside a string literal that the length shortcuts
(`instructions` >= 8192 chars, or a single chunk that alone covers the
remaining budget) prove the cap without encoding. Surrogates skipped that way
yield the 8192 cap like any other large payload.

## GPT-6 Astra permission

Use **APIs > Edit API key > Allow GPT-6 Astra** to enable access for selected keys. New and existing keys default to off after migration. For example, enable the personal key and leave a shared key disabled to reserve Astra access for the personal key.

The permission is independent of Allowed models and Apply to codex /model. An enabled key still needs Astra in its allowlist when one is configured, an eligible account or model source, and quota. Enforcing Astra as the model does not grant permission. Calls without an authenticated key are denied Astra, even with proxy authentication disabled.

Permission updates use the existing authorization-cache invalidation interval across workers; in-flight requests are not canceled. The migration adds a false default for historical rows, so enable intended keys after upgrading. Reverting this feature restores the previous unrestricted policy.
